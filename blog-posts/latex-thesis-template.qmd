<!-- ## What's this all about? -->

<!-- I don't know about you, but in the course of my research I do a lot of things that don't make it into the final product. -->

<!-- It almost became an intrusive thought process: "If I knew this six months ago this would have taken me a day instead of a month. If only I could go back, I wouldn't waste all that time!" -->

<!-- **put in that PHD comic where the guy wasted a day in his pyjamas** -->

<!-- But it's **not** actually wasted time, is it? The "real" work wouldn't happen without it, and a lot of it is necessary for our own learning process. -->

<!-- So much of that work is thrown away, and unless someone happens to ask us about it -->

<!-- Let's not reinvent the wheel. -->

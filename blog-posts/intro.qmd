# Let's start a blog!

I don't know about you, but in the course of my research I do a lot of things that don't make it to the final product.

**put in that PHD comic where the guy wasted a day in his pyjamas**

But that's **not** actually wasted time, is it? The "real" work wouldn't happen without it, and a lot of it is necessary for our own learning process. 
So much of that work is thrown away, and unless someone happens to ask us about it

Let's not reinvent the wheel.

Despite having a rich diversity of native macroalgae species, the seaweed farming industry in Australia is in its infancy. Demand for seaweed and seaweed-derived products continues to increase, however, and native Australian genera like Asparagopsis are of particular interest.\nThis project is using a macroalgae growth model created by Scott Hadley that I further developed during my PhD to assess the bioremediation potential of a number of Australian macroalgae species in a culture setting. In addition to using my own expertise and the knowledge available within IMAS, I am also working with the Australian Sustainable Seaweed Alliance to incorporate famers’ perspectives and knowledge into the modelling effort.",

I designed and built this whole website using Quarto.\nWhile the site is technically done, I’ll continue to update it now and then as I have the time. In particular I want to stay up to date on my blog.\n\n\nWhy did I do this?\nDon’t get me wrong, I like all the various tools and services available to researchers nowadays. But when you’re expected to keep your ResearchGate, GoogleScholar, WebOfScience, LinkedIn and OrcID profiles up to date (not to mention your various lab websites, institutional platforms, journal accounts, and whatever we eventually decide to replace Twitter with) it can all get a bit much.\nI really wanted a central place to consolidate all my stuff. Anyone who wants to find information on me, my projects, or my work can now come straight to the source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFishSize Project Lab\nThe whole reason I learned to use Quarto is because the FishSize Project Lab was looking for someone to revamp their website. It was a steep learning curve but I think the website looks pretty good now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigFish\nAfter working on the FishSize Project Lab website I got to work on the much more ambitious BigFish game website project. This one really stretched the capabilities of Quarto and forced me to properly learn the intricacies of CSS and SASS.",

    "text": "Wasted time and invaluable junk\nI don’t know about you, but in the course of my PhD research I ended up doing a lot of things that didn’t seem to make it into the final product.\nThoughts about the time spent on that work almost became intrusive: “If I knew how to do this six months ago, this next part would have taken me a day instead of a month. If only I could go back, I wouldn’t waste all that time!”\n\n \n\nBut it’s not really wasted time, is it? I firmly believe that the most valuable “final product” of a PhD project is not the thesis, or a paper, or any particular research, but you as a reasearcher. And in the production of you as a researcher, the time spent clumsily figuring things out is absolutely necessary.\nStill, it feels wrong to leave it at that.    The learning experience was valuable, sure, but now the experience has been learned from and all the junk left over is just cluttering up my already cluttered brain. I have nowhere to put it, and unless someone very specifically asks me for it, it might never be unearthed again.\nWhich makes me wonder: how many others have solved the same problem before, or since? How many times have we all quietly, and independently, reinvented the wheel?\nThe first time I visited my Master’s supervisor in February 2011, he had a to-do list written on a whiteboard in his office without about 20 items on it. I remember thinking that a whiteboard was a brilliant idea! Surely it allowed him to easily remove, change, or re-order his items at any time (you have to remember that this was before productivity apps were a billion-dollar industry - most uni students didn’t even take their laptops to lectures). I was a little disappointed that no tasks relating to my project were ever added to the list, but it ended up being a good thing. The last time I visited his office in December of 2013, that whiteboard was still there and that to-do list still had the same 20 items on it. He’d probably need industrial solvent to rub them off now.\nBut he was also the supervisor who told me that everyone researcher has a drawer full of unfinished projects and unanalysed data. He introduced me to a researcher who had been collecting fish otolith (earbone) samples for decades, and who was willing to send those samples to me to use in my research. Why had he been collecting them for so long? No reason! What was he planning to do with them before I came along? Nothing! As far as I can tell, he was just collecting for the sake of it, and if someone came along and gave his samples a purpose, all the better.\nThe point of this long and rambling story is to try and express why I feel like I need a place to put all my random musings, code snippets, and other unpublishable miscellany. It’s a way of pulling the information out of my brain and laying it out in a searchable format for the benefit of all. Neat!",

Jensen, Stephen E. Swearer\nScientific Reports, 2016\n\n\nThe rapid growth of aquaculture raises questions about the welfare status of mass-produced species. Sagittal otoliths are primary hearing structures in the inner ear of all teleost (bony) fishes and are normally composed of aragonite, though abnormal vaterite replacement is sometimes seen in the wild. We provide the first widespread evaluation of the prevalence of vaterite in otoliths, showing that farmed fish have levels of vaterite replacement over 10 times… Read more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapid growth causes abnormal vaterite formation in farmed fish otoliths\nTormey Reimer, Tim Dempster, Anna Wargelius, Per Gunnar Fjelldal, Tom Hansen, Kevin A. Glover, Monica F. Solberg, Stephen E. Swearer\nJournal of Evolutionary Biology, 2017\n\n\nSagittal otoliths are essential components of the sensory organs that enable all teleost fish to hear and maintain balance, and are primarily composed of calcium carbonate. A deformity, where aragonite (the normal crystal form) is replaced with vaterite, was first noted over 50 years ago but its underlying cause is unresolved. We evaluated the prevalence of vateritic otoliths from two captive rearing studies which suggested that fast growth, due to environmental… Read more",

Swearer, Tormey Reimer\nThe Conversation, May 3, 2016\nThe swift rise of aquaculture as a major supplier of protein to the world is a remarkable story of rapid domestication of marine and freshwater animals.\nJust a few years ago, the world produced more tonnage of farmed fish than it did beef. With billions of farmed fish now in production systems, the lives fish lead and their welfare status have… Read more",

Despite having a rich diversity of native macroalgae species, the seaweed farming industry in Australia is in its infancy. Demand for seaweed and seaweed-derived products continues to increase, however, and native Australian genera like Asparagopsis are of particular interest.\nThis project is using a macroalgae growth model created by Scott Hadley that I further developed during my PhD to assess the bioremediation potential of a number of Australian macroalgae species in a culture setting. In addition to using my own expertise and the knowledge available within IMAS, I am also working with the Australian Sustainable Seaweed Alliance to incorporate famers’ perspectives and knowledge into the modelling effort.",

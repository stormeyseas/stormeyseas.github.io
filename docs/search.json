Sagittal otoliths are primary hearing structures in the inner ear of all teleost (bony) fishes and are normally composed of aragonite, though abnormal vaterite replacement is sometimes seen in the wild.

Glover, Monica F. Solberg, Stephen E. Swearer\nJournal of Evolutionary Biology, 2017\n\n\nSagittal otoliths are essential components of the sensory organs that enable all teleost fish to hear and maintain balance, and are primarily composed of calcium carbonate. A deformity, where aragonite (the normal crystal form) is replaced with vaterite, was first noted over 50 years ago but its underlying cause is unresolved. We evaluated the prevalence of vateritic otoliths from two captive rearing studies which suggested that fast growth, due to environmental… Read more",

    "text": "A few weeks ago I attended Ocean Hack Week at the ANU Kioloa Campus in NSW.\nDenisse Fierro and Nick Mortimer did a fantastic job of organising, and I really liked the format of working on projects interspersed with relevant tutorials. I chose a project based in the R shiny package, basically using the whole OHW as an excuse to teach myself shiny. I also liked the variety of activities that balanced the focus of the week (staring at computers) with beach walks and social activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all immediately got a sense for what a kook Nick was when he met us absurdly early at the airport with this energy\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, I was a little nervous about attending a “hack week” event. It seems like the sort of thing that only serious hardcore programmers attend, you know? But the vibe wasn’t like that at all. I was probably one of 2 or 3 people with advanced experience in R, and while others had more experience in Python it wasn’t a huge deal and we could still communicate at the same level about how to solve ocean-related problems. My only real criticism of the week is that there was a planned workshop that didn’t end up happening and it was the one I was most looking forward to - basically an introduction to machine learning in the context of ocean data. Oh well, maybe next time!\n\n\n\nAll my clothes smell like smoke now\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a well-known fact among small-conference aficionados (like myself) that every organiser has their own “thing” - a pet activity that makes their conference just a little different. I’ve attended conferences where that “thing” has been wine tastings (highly recommend) or group runs at dawn (less good), but this time the activity was karaoke.\nNick brought a karaoke machine loaded with every song under the sun, so one highlight of my week was absolutely shredding my voice on Don’t Stop Believing and getting some laughs with a comedy rendition of What’s Going On.\n\n\n\n\n\nI got exactly zero pictures of me working and exactly one picture of the karaoke, so you know where my priorities are at.\n\n\n\n\nBut in between screaming my voice hoarse and picking up waaaaay too many shells on the beach, I did actually make some cool changes to a model comparison and selection tool for FishMIP and made some friends too. Looking forward to OHW2025!\n\n\n\nOne of the beaches we walked on - I picked up over 30 baby abalone shells!",

    "text": "Wasted time and invaluable junk\nI don’t know about you, but in the course of my PhD research I ended up doing a lot of things that didn’t seem to make it into the final product.\nThoughts about the time spent on that work almost became intrusive: “If I knew how to do this six months ago, this next part would have taken me a day instead of a month. If only I could go back, I wouldn’t waste all that time!”\n\n \n\nBut it’s not really wasted time, is it? I firmly believe that the most valuable “final product” of a PhD project is not the thesis, or a paper, or any particular research, but you as a reasearcher. And in the production of you as a researcher, the time spent clumsily figuring things out is absolutely necessary.\nStill, it feels wrong to leave it at that.    The learning experience was valuable, sure, but now the experience has been learned from and all the junk left over is just cluttering up my already cluttered brain. I have nowhere to put it, and unless someone very specifically asks me for it, it might never be unearthed again.\nWhich makes me wonder: how many others have solved the same problem before, or since? How many times have we all quietly, and independently, reinvented the wheel?\nThe first time I visited my Master’s supervisor in February 2011, he had a to-do list written on a whiteboard in his office without about 20 items on it. I remember thinking that a whiteboard was a brilliant idea! Surely it allowed him to easily remove, change, or re-order his items at any time (you have to remember that this was before productivity apps were a billion-dollar industry - most uni students didn’t even take their laptops to lectures). I was a little disappointed that no tasks relating to my project were ever added to the list, but it ended up being a good thing. The last time I visited his office in December of 2013, that whiteboard was still there and that to-do list still had the same 20 items on it. He’d probably need industrial solvent to rub them off now.\nBut he was also the supervisor who told me that everyone researcher has a drawer full of unfinished projects and unanalysed data. He introduced me to a researcher who had been collecting fish otolith (earbone) samples for decades, and who was willing to send those samples to me to use in my research. Why had he been collecting them for so long? No reason! What was he planning to do with them before I came along? Nothing! As far as I can tell, he was just collecting for the sake of it, and if someone came along and gave his samples a purpose, all the better.\nThe point of this long and rambling story is to try and express why I feel like I need a place to put all my random musings, code snippets, and other unpublishable miscellany. It’s a way of pulling the information out of my brain and laying it out in a searchable format for the benefit of all. Neat!",

The major features being used within the template are below, but if you want to dive into all the possibilities you can check out the package documentation here. If you’re looking to use acronyms for in-text citations (i.e. using “FAO (2003)” instead of “Food and Agriculture Organisation (2003)”) see ?@sec-citation-aliases on citation aliases.\nAll acronyms used in the entire thesis are defined within the other_content/acronyms.tex file, like so:\n\\acro{hab}[HAB]{harmful algal bloom}\nEach acronym is given a unique name that’s easy to reference within the text. The standard command to use an acronym is . Using this command adds , defines it in full in the text the first time, and uses the abbreviated form subsequent times. You can then use them in text with the following commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\nThis inserts the acronym into the text, either in the short or long version depending on whether it’s been used in this chapter yet. It also adds the acronym to the list of acronyms in the preface if it wasn’t there already.\n\n\n\nThis does the same as , except it uses the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlurals and articles\nWhen you use in the text, you’re never quite sure if the final product will show the long or short name, and this can create pluralisation problems. For instance, if you write the plural manually as “Work on s is important”, you might get the nice sentence “Work on HABs is important” or the ugly sentence “Work on harmful algal bloom (HAB)s is important”.\nThe neat way to solve this is by defining custom pluralisations within the acronyms package, then using the command in text. For instance, you can put the following code in\n\\acro{ena}[ENA]{ecological network analysis}\n    \\acroplural{ena}[]{ecological network analyses}\nYou can do a lot more with the acronyms package (like adding different pluralisations for the long and short versions of an acronym) which you can find in the package documentation here.\nTo use an acronym within the text, use the command along with the unique acronym name.\n\n\nAPA7 citation and modified apacite {#sec-apacite}\ncitation aliases {#sec-citation-aliases}",

See the full project and the latest research outputs here.\n\n\nProject details\nThis project aims to assess the global and local consequences of changing feeds in aquaculture by developing a new interdisciplinary sustainability assessment framework. The project expects to generate new methods to understand and predict local farm-to-ecosystem changes and global environmental footprints under contrasting feed and climate scenarios by integrating field data with novel experiments, modelling techniques and global mapping of terrestrial and marine feed raw materials and their impacts. Expected outcomes include new methods to assess ecological, social and economic trade-offs under different feeds to inform decision making in support of an ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture spanning global to local scales.",

Despite having a rich diversity of native macroalgae species, the seaweed farming industry in Australia is in its infancy. Demand for seaweed and seaweed-derived products continues to increase, however, and native Australian genera like Asparagopsis are of particular interest.\nThis project used a macroalgae growth model created by Scott Hadley that I further developed during my PhD to assess the bioremediation potential of a number of Australian macroalgae species in a culture setting. In addition to using my own expertise and the knowledge available within IMAS, I also worked with the Australian Sustainable Seaweed Alliance to incorporate famers’ perspectives and knowledge into the modelling effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis website\nWhat could be a better use of my time as I wait for feedback on my PhD thesis than slowly moving more and more of my life into RStudio? I designed and built this whole website using Quarto.\nWhile the site is technically done, I’ll continue to update it now and then as I have the time. In particular I want to stay up to date on my blog.\n\n\nWhy did I do this?\nDon’t get me wrong, I like all the various tools and services available to researchers nowadays. But when you’re expected to keep your ResearchGate, GoogleScholar, WebOfScience, LinkedIn and OrcID profiles up to date (not to mention your various lab websites, institutional platforms, journal accounts, and whatever we eventually decide to replace Twitter with) it can all get a bit much.\nI really wanted a central place to consolidate all my stuff. Anyone who wants to find information on me, my projects, or my work can now come straight to the source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFishSize Project Lab\nThe whole reason I learned to use Quarto is because the FishSize Project Lab was looking for someone to revamp their website. It was a steep learning curve but I think the website looks pretty good now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigFish\nAfter working on the FishSize Project Lab website I got to work on the much more ambitious BigFish game website project. This one really stretched the capabilities of Quarto and forced me to properly learn the intricacies of CSS and SASS.",

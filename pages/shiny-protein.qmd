# Proteins

- I found a comparison of protein content vs price per gram for a bunch of different foods online, BUT the comparison was for US foods and prices and it looked heinous

```{r setup}
#| include: false

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

```{r data}
df.pro <- read.csv(file = "/blog-posts/data-files/protein.csv")
```

```{r protein comparison}
#| fig-align: center
#| warning: false

p <- ggplot(df.pro, 
            aes(x = protein.100g, 
                y = price.kg)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(p)
```

### Data detail and sources

I shop at Woolies mostly, so I've primarily relied on Woolworths products and prices for this comparison. In order to get consistent and realistic prices I've tried to use generically-branded versions of products coming in ~1kg packaging and stick to products produced in Australia rather than imported. I know you care about these things, you *nerd*.

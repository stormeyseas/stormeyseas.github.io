# Proteins

- I found a comparison of protein content vs price per gram for a bunch of different foods online, BUT the comparison was for US foods and prices and it looked heinous

```{r setup}
#| include: false

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r data}
df.pro <- read.csv(file = "blog-posts/data-files/protein.csv")
df.pro$type <- c(rep("seafood", 4), rep("meat", 11), rep("other", 3), rep("dairy", 3), rep("dairy alt", 3), rep("dairy", 4), "seafood", rep("other", 2), "legumes", "other", rep("legumes", 3), rep("nuts", 4), rep("grains", 2))
df.pro <- df.pro %>% 
    mutate(type = as.factor(type),
           protein.g = protein.100g*unit.kg*0.01*1000, # g protein in the package
           price.100g.protein = 100*unit.price/protein.g)
```

```{r protein comparison}
#| fig-align: center
#| warning: false

p <- ggplot(df.pro, 
            aes(label = shortname, 
                x = protein.100g, 
                y = price.kg,
                color = type)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(hjust = "left", nudge_x = 0.25, nudge_y = 0.75, size = 2.5) +
    
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    labs(x = "Protein density (g protein per 100 g of food)",
        y = "Price per 100 g of food (AUD)")

p
```

```{r protein comparison 2}
#| fig-align: center
#| warning: false

# Average daily consumption recommendation is 60g per day
df.pro <- df.pro %>% 
    mutate(weight.60g.protein = 100*60/protein.100g, # how much to eat per day
           price.60g.protein = price.100g.protein*(60/100) # how much that would cost
               )

p2 <- ggplot(df.pro, 
            aes(label = shortname,

                y = price.60g.protein,

### Data detail and sources

I shop at Woolies mostly, so I've primarily relied on Woolworths products and prices for this comparison. In order to get consistent and realistic prices I've tried to use generically-branded versions of products coming in ~1kg packaging and stick to products produced in Australia rather than imported. I know you care about these things, you *nerd*.

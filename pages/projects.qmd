### This website

What could be a better use of my time as I wait for feedback on my PhD thesis than slowly moving more and more of my life into RStudio? I designed and built this whole website using Quarto.

While the site is *technically* done, I'll continue to update it now and then as I have the time. In particular I want to stay up to date on my [blog](blog.qmd).

#### Why did I do this?

Don't get me wrong, I like all the various tools and services available to researchers nowadays. But when you're expected to keep your 
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tormey-Reimer), 
[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H45vLccAAAAJ&hl=en), 
[WebOfScience](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AGU-1273-2022), 
[LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/tormey-reimer) and 
[OrcID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5983-2798) 
profiles up to date (not to mention your various lab websites, institutional platforms, journal accounts, and whatever we eventually decide to replace Twitter with) it can all get a bit much.

I really wanted a central place to consolidate all my **stuff**. Anyone who wants to find information on me, my projects, or my work can now come straight to the source.

### FishSize Project Lab

The whole reason I learned to use Quarto is because the [FishSize Project Lab](https://fishsizeproject.org/) was looking for someone to revamp their website. It was a steep learning curve but I think the website looks pretty good now!

### BigFish

After working on the FishSize Project Lab website I got to work on the much more ambitious [BigFish game website](https://bigfishcardgame.com/) project. This one really stretched the capabilities of Quarto and forced me to properly learn the intricacies of CSS and SASS.

## Upcoming projects

I'm pretty slammed with work right now... so rather than lining up more projects I'm going to take a nap.

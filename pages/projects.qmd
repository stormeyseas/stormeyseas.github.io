### This website

What could be a better use of my time as I wait for feedback on my PhD thesis than slowly moving more and more of my life into RStudio? I designed and built this whole website using Quarto.

#### So why did I do this at all?

Don't get me wrong, I like all the various tools and services available to researchers nowadays. But when you're expected to keep your 
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tormey-Reimer), 
[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H45vLccAAAAJ&hl=en), 
[WebOfScience](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AGU-1273-2022), 
[LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/tormey-reimer) and 
[OrcID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5983-2798) 
profiles up to date (not to mention your various lab websites, institutional platforms, journal accounts, and whatever we eventually decide to replace Twitter with) it can all get a bit much.

I really wanted a central place to consolidate all my **stuff**. Anyone who wants to find information on me, my projects, or my work can now come straight to the source.

## Upcoming projects

Right now I'm working on a website for the [Fish Size Project Lab](https://fishsizeproject.github.io/lab_website/) and re-vanping the [Sustainable Inland Fisheries](https://sif.lt) website. I'll also be trying to update my [blog](blog.qmd) regularly in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!

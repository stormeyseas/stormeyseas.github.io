Here I'll be collecting written pieces that I've published in peer-reviewed journals or news outlets. If you're looking for details of a talk I've given at a conference, please [contact me](contact.qmd).

#| label: Sci Rep abstract

abstract = "The rapid growth of aquaculture raises questions about the welfare status of mass-produced species. Sagittal otoliths are primary hearing structures in the inner ear of all teleost (bony) fishes and are normally composed of aragonite, though abnormal vaterite replacement is sometimes seen in the wild. We provide the first widespread evaluation of the prevalence of vaterite in otoliths, showing that farmed fish have levels of vaterite replacement over 10 times higher than wild fish, regardless of species. We confirm this observation with extensive sampling of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway, the world’s largest producer and verify that vateritic otoliths are common in farmed salmon worldwide..."

#| label: J Evo Biol abstract
#| include: FALSE

abstract = "Sagittal otoliths are essential components of the sensory organs that enable all teleost fish to hear and maintain balance, and are primarily composed of calcium carbonate. A deformity, where aragonite (the normal crystal form) is replaced with vaterite, was first noted over 50 years ago but its underlying cause is unresolved. We evaluated the prevalence of vateritic otoliths from two captive rearing studies which suggested that fast growth, due to environmental rather than genetic control, led to vaterite development..."

#### [Listen up: many farmed fish are hard of hearing – here’s why it matters](https://theconversation.com/listen-up-many-farmed-fish-are-hard-of-hearing-heres-why-it-matters-58587)

#| label: Conv fish farm abstract
#| include: FALSE

abstract = "The swift rise of aquaculture as a major supplier of protein to the world is a remarkable story of rapid domestication of marine and freshwater animals.

Just a few years ago, the world produced more tonnage of farmed fish than it did beef. With billions of farmed fish now in production systems, the lives fish lead and their welfare status have come under increasing scrutiny.

In this context, research we published this week has revealed that half of the world’s most farmed marine fish have a deformity that compromises one of their primary senses: hearing."

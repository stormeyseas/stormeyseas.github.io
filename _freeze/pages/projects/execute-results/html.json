Despite having a rich diversity of native macroalgae species, the seaweed farming industry in Australia is in its infancy. Demand for seaweed and seaweed-derived products continues to increase, however, and native Australian genera like [_Asparagopsis_](https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-06-30/asparagopsis-methane-reducing-seaweed-sold-in-australia/101198580?utm_campaign=abc_news_web&utm_content=link&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_source=abc_news_web) are of particular interest.\n\nThis project is using a macroalgae growth model created by Scott Hadley that I further developed during my PhD to model the bioremediation potential of a number of macroalgae species in a culture setting. In addition to using my own expertise and the knowledge available within IMAS, I am also working with the [Australian Sustainable Seaweed Alliance](https://www.seaweedalliance.org.au/) to incorporate famers' perspectives and knowledge into the modelling effort.\n\n<!-- details -->\n::::\n:::\n\n## Past projects\n\n::: {.grid .justify-content-space-evenly .align-items-center}\n:::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-lg-4 .text-center}\n![](../resources/images/personal-website.jpg){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the website you're on right now... so meta!\" style=\"border: solid 1px var(--bs-primary);\"}\n::::\n\n:::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-lg-8 .text-center}\n### This website\n\nWhat could be a better use of my time as I wait for feedback on my PhD thesis than slowly moving more and more of my life into RStudio? I designed and built this whole website using Quarto.\n\nWhile the site is *technically* done, I'll continue to update it now and then as I have the time. In particular I want to stay up to date on my [blog](blog.qmd).\n::::\n\n:::: g-col-12\n#### Why did I do this?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like all the various tools and services available to researchers nowadays. But when you're expected to keep your \n[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tormey-Reimer), \n[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H45vLccAAAAJ&hl=en), \n[WebOfScience](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AGU-1273-2022), \n[LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/tormey-reimer) and \n[OrcID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5983-2798) \nprofiles up to date (not to mention your various lab websites, institutional platforms, journal accounts, and whatever we eventually decide to replace Twitter with) it can all get a bit much.\n\nI really wanted a central place to consolidate all my **stuff**. Anyone who wants to find information on me, my projects, or my work can now come straight to the source. \n::::\n\n:::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-lg-6 .align-items-top .no-gaps}\n::::: {.g-col-12 .img-container .no-gaps}\n![](../resources/images/FishSizeHomepage.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the FishSizeProject website\"}\n::::: \n\n::::: g-col-12\n### FishSize Project Lab\n\nThe whole reason I learned to use Quarto is because the [FishSize Project Lab](https://fishsizeproject.org/) was looking for someone to revamp their website. It was a steep learning curve but I think the website looks pretty good now!\n::::: \n::::\n\n:::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-lg-6 .align-items-top}\n::::: {.g-col-12 .img-container .no-gaps}\n![](../resources/images/BigFishHomepage.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of the BigFish website\"}\n\n::::: \n\n::::: g-col-12\n### BigFish\n\nAfter working on the FishSize Project Lab website I got to work on the much more ambitious [BigFish game website](https://bigfishcardgame.com/) project. This one really stretched the capabilities of Quarto and forced me to properly learn the intricacies of CSS and SASS. \n::::: \n::::\n:::\n\n## Upcoming projects\n\nI'm pretty slammed with work right now... so rather than lining up more projects I'm going to take a nap.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

### This website

I know I'm supposed to be a scientist, but I also designed and built this whole website. And the best part? It was all done in R! Contact me if you want to know how you can move even more of your life into RStudio.

#### [High prevalence of vaterite in sagittal otoliths causes hearing impairment in farmed fish](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25249)

Tormey Reimer, Tim Dempster, Fletcher Warren-Myers, Arne J. Jensen, Stephen E. Swearer

*Scientific reports, 2016*

The rapid growth of aquaculture raises questions about the welfare status of mass-produced species. Sagittal otoliths are primary hearing structures in the inner ear of all teleost (bony) fishes and are normally composed of aragonite, though abnormal vaterite replacement is sometimes seen in the wild. We provide the first widespread evaluation of the prevalence of vaterite in otoliths, showing that...
<!-- farmed fish have levels of vaterite replacement over 10 times higher than wild fish, regardless of species. We confirm this observation with extensive sampling of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway, the world’s largest producer and verify that vateritic otoliths are common in farmed salmon worldwide. Using a mechanistic model of otolith oscillation in response to sound, we demonstrate that average levels of vaterite replacement result in a 28–50% loss of otolith functionality across most of a salmonid’s known hearing -->

#### [Rapid growth causes abnormal vaterite formation in farmed fish otoliths](https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.148056)

*Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 2017*

Sagittal otoliths are essential components of the sensory organs that enable all teleost fish to hear and maintain balance, and are primarily composed of calcium carbonate. A deformity, where aragonite (the normal crystal form) is replaced with vaterite, was first noted over 50 years ago but its underlying cause is unresolved. We evaluated the prevalence of vateritic otoliths...
<!-- from two captive rearing studies which suggested that fast growth, due to environmental rather than genetic control, led to vaterite development. We then tested this by varying light and temperature to create phenotypes with different growth rates, which resulted in fast growers (5 times larger) having 3 times more vaterite than slow growers. A decrease in either the ratio of otolith matrix proteins (otolin-1/OMM-64) or [Ca2+]/[CO32−] may explain why fast growth causes vaterite deposition. As vaterite decreases hearing sensitivity, reducing -->

I'm not currently working or responding to emails. Maybe I'm on holiday. You can send me a message but it might be a while before you get a reply.

I'm currently working but will probably be slow to respond to emails - I might be somewhere with limited internet access, or maybe I'm just very busy. You can still send me a message but it might be a while before you get a reply.
